## Technical Innovations

### Bathtub Curve Implementation
Realistic equipment reliability modeling with three distinct phases:

```python
# Calibrated failure rates for 98.5% fleet availability
'infant_mortality_rate': 0.020,     # 2.0% in first 1000 hrs (decreasing)
'random_failure_rate': 0.0008,      # 0.08% constant rate during useful life  
'wearout_acceleration': 0.00005,    # Minimal exponential increase
```

### MDP Optimization
- **States**: Equipment health levels (Failed, Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
- **Actions**: Do Nothing, Light Maintenance, Heavy Maintenance, Emergency Repair, Replace
- **Objective**: Minimize long-term expected costs while maximizing availability

### Hybrid Data Strategy
Combines strengths of real datasets with simulation flexibility:
- **Real foundation**: AI4I 2020 provides authentic failure patterns
- **Extended simulation**: Time-series generation for longitudinal analysis
- **Economic modeling**: Realistic cost structures and business metrics
